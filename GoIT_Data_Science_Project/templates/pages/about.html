            Neural networks reflect the behavior of the human brain, allowing computer programs to recognize patterns
            and solve common problems in the fields of AI, machine learning, and deep learning.<br>
            <br>
            Neural networks, also known as artificial neural networks (ANNs) or simulated neural networks (SNNs), are a
            subset of machine learning and are at the heart of deep learning algorithms. Their name and structure are
            inspired by the human brain, mimicking the way that biological neurons signal to one another.
            Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are comprised of a node layers, containing an input layer, one or more
            hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node, or artificial neuron, connects to another and has an
            associated weight and threshold. If the output of any individual node is above the specified threshold
            value, that node is activated, sending data to the next layer of the network. Otherwise, no data is passed
            along to the next layer of the network.<br>
            <br>
            Neural networks rely on training data to learn and improve their accuracy over time. However, once these
            learning algorithms are fine-tuned for accuracy, they are powerful tools in computer science and artificial
            intelligence, allowing us to classify and cluster data at a high velocity. Tasks in speech recognition or
            image recognition can take minutes versus hours when compared to the manual identification by human experts.
            One of the most well-known neural networks is Googleâ€™s search algorithm.<br>
            <br>
            Neural networks can be classified into different types, which are used for different purposes. This site was
            designed to process images and predict what is shown on them. At the moment, our neural networks can predict
            such classes: Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck.
